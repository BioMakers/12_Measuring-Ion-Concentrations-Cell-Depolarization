This is a technical description of how the ion sensitive electordes are set up for the depolarization experiment. The example given is only
for sodium and chloride measurements. The experiment gives a real time measurement of these ions in parts per million. The arduino sketch should
be modified based on calibration measurements with standard solutions. This should be performed for each batch of experiments

Pictures of the measurement set up can be found in

This shows how the setup would look for a calibration sample of 100ml of buffered salt solution
These show the setup for measuring Sodium and Chloride at the same time. The chloride channel has a single electrode, the sodium channel has
the detection electrode and a reference electrode combined into a single potential difference.
The two bread boards are for each "channel" one for sodium, one for chloride. The circuit diagram for these op-amp non-inverting circuits are
given in the file "cdi.pdf"
The setup uses an Arduino Uno. The sketch file for this is also given for this example setup: "Cl_Na_electrode.ino". The calibration parameters
are set at the top of the sketch.

In this example set up, the Chloride voltage is read at the A0 analogue channel of the Arduino and the sodium at the A1 channel. 
The final experiment requires the addition of a potassium ion-sensitive electrode which could be similarly amplified to the Cl- electrode
and attached to the A2 channel. The script would then need updating to include these values as well.
